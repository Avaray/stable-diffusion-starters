## FAQ

`Q` Will you add more models?  
`A` Maybe. Currently I need to create templates manually, because these services does not provide API for managing templates. Believe me, it's a pain.

`Q` Will you add checkpoint X?  
`A` If it's a good checkpoint, yes. Please open [an discussion](https://github.com/Avaray/stable-diffusion-starters/discussions/new?category=ideas). But keep in mind that model must be battle tested on [CivitAI](https://civitai.com/models) and have good results.

`Q` Will you add more services?  
`A` Maybe. Currently I don't know any better or at least as good as current ones.
